## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Users can now edit the weightings, but only for specific attributes, and for the pre-existing calculation

## [1.0.0] - 2022-03-12
Welcome to version 1 of this interface to the mentor-matching project! Thanks to a change in the underlying package we use, we've had to make a bit of a tweak to the package. So we figured why not actually write a changelog for this, for the first time ever?

### Added
- Default weightings for the matchings. These can be found in [the `run_task` route](./app/main/routes.py)
